# Logistic-Regression
<p> Data from a telecommunications provider is analyzed using logistic regression to create a predictive model. The model tests if a customer is likely to churn based on certain attributes. A Jupyter Notebook and the Python 3 programming language is used for this analysis. The data is prepared, and summary statistics are presented using Numpy. Univariate and bivariate visualizations are created with Matplotlib and Seaborn. An initial model is produced, and a logistic regression is performed on the variables. A reduced model is created and compared to the initial model. An accuracy of 83% was achieved for this churn model. </p>
